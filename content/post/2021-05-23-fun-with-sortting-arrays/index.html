<h1>Problem</h1>
<p>Solving challenges on <a href="https://projecteuler.net">project Euler</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a> is a good past time. For folks working in the wider analaytical / data science field, places like project Euler provide an excellent opportunity to work with academic programming concepts that do not frequently appear in real-life. I was looking at common problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers [1, 2, 3, …, n] without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.<br />
Example
Perform the following steps:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>i   arr                     swap (indices)
0   [7, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,3)  
1   [2, 1, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (0,1)  
2   [1, 2, 3, 7, 4, 5, 6]   swap (3,4)  
3   [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 5, 6]   swap (4,5)  
4   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6]   swap (5,6)  
5   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  </code></pre>
<p><em>It took swaps to sort the array.</em></p>

<h2>First attempt</h2>
<p>After completing the problem, I like to explore literature and search or post on <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com">CodeReview</a> for feedback. My initial solution simply involved re-starting array sort and counting each approach. As arrays are consisting of unordered consecutive integers ∈ [1, 2, 3, …, n], the easiest solution</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def minimumSwaps(arr):
    # Add zero to avoid the need of shifting the index so all the loops
    # are working fine
    arr.insert(0, 0)
    num_sorts = 0
    while arr != sorted(arr):
        for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
            if idx != val:
                arr[idx], arr[val] = arr[val], arr[idx]
                num_sorts += 1
                break
    return num_sorts</code></pre>
<p>The solution returns the correct results but times out for 6 cases that consists of bigger arrays.</p>
<p><strong>Passed tests: 8 / 14</strong></p>

<h2>Second attempt</h2>
<p>My first thought was to quickly optimise the existing code by looking for quick wins. The sorting operation in <code>while arr != sorted(arr)</code> could be optimised by storing sorted object (as each array has only one sorted order that meets the criteria).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def minimumSwaps(arr):
    # Add zero to avoid the need of shifting the index so all the loops
    # are working fine
    arr.insert(0, 0)
    num_sorts = 0
    array_sorted = sorted(arr) # First optimisation
    while arr != array_sorted:
        for idx, val in enumerate(arr):
            if idx != val:
                arr[idx], arr[val] = arr[val], arr[idx]
                num_sorts += 1
                break
    return num_sorts</code></pre>
<p>The line <code>array_sorted = sorted(arr)</code> makes the solution time out only once.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>I don’t remember where I’ve seen this statement but someone once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAM is cheap, thinking is expensive</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some principles that this solution breaks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First</strong> a good program computes what is has to and only that. The task is to return <em>the numbers of steps</em> not to <em>sort.</em> Sorting implies actual movement of elements in array and potentially will have a different (likely worse) memory footprint to a purely algebraic solution.</li>
<li><strong>Second,</strong> a premature optimisation is frequent source of bugs.</li>
</ul>
