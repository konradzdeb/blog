# Challenge

File manipulation is a frequent task unavoidable in every business. Traditionally, file manipulation challenges are considered within the ramifications of specific tools native to a given system. As such, the one may consider writing and scheduling shell script to undertake frequent file operations or using more specific purpose-built tools like [`logrotate`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate) in order to archive and clean logs or tools like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html) are used to build streaming-data pipelines. R is usually though of as a statistical programming or language or, more incorrectly, as an environment for a statistical analysis. Arguably, R is a mature progaming language. What constitues a *programming language* is a good question. Wikipedia offers somehow wide definition:

> A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
