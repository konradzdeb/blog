<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>File manipulation is a frequent task unavoidable in every business. Traditionally, file manipulation challenges are considered within the ramifications of specific tools native to a given system. As such, the one may consider writing and scheduling shell script to undertake frequent file operations or using more specific purpose-built tools like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate"><code>logrotate</code></a> in order to archive and clean logs or tools like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html">Kafka</a> are used to build streaming-data pipelines. R is usually though of as a statistical programming or language or, more incorrectly, as an environment for a statistical analysis. R is a mature programming language. What constitutes a <em>programming language</em> is a good question. Wikipedia offers somehow wide definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

<h1>Pros and Cons of Using R as an ETL solution</h1>

<div id="pros" class="section level2">
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>The article assumes that consideration on whether to utilise R within a team for pure ETL tasks is usually given in the context of R language being utilised to greater or lesser degree to facilitate data modelling, analytical or statistical work. In that context utilising R yields benefits mostly associated with ability to utilise the existing knowledge. Furthermore, as discussed later, R development team will be able to leverage the existing knowledge or expertise in accomplishing tasks that would traditionally</li>
<li>R is an exceptionally flexible language and offered data structures lend themselves well for file manipulation</li>
<li>There is <em>some</em> chance for our production process to be able to rely on cross</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="cons" class="section level2">
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Using R for file manipulation only defeats the purpose of the languages, in effect we will be pulling a number of dependecies to achive a number of tasks that usually can be successfully accomplished using tool found across majority of commonly available stacks, such as <code>find</code>, <code>sed</code> and so forth</li>
