<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>File manipulation is a frequent task unavoidable in almost every IT business process. Traditionally, file manipulation challenges are considered within the ramifications of specific tools native to a given system. As such, the one may consider writing and scheduling shell script to undertake frequent file operations or using more specific purpose-built tools like <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate"><code>logrotate</code></a> in order to archive and clean logs or tools like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/20/documentation.html">Kafka</a> are used to build streaming-data pipelines. R is usually though of as a statistical programming or language or, more incorrectly, as an environment for a statistical analysis. R is a mature programming language. What constitutes a <em>programming language</em> is a valid question. Wikipedia offers somehow wide definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.</p>

<h1>Pros and Cons of Using R as an ETL solution</h1>
<p>R wasn’t designed to replace ETL<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> processes; nevertheless, as every other well-developed programming language R offers a set of robust tools for accomplising file manipulation, analysis and creation. In particular, R package ecosystem offers a layer that provides a clean interface for accomplishing traditional</p>
<div id="pros" class="section level2">
<h2>Pros</h2>
<ul>
<li>The article assumes that consideration on whether to utilise R within a team for pure ETL tasks is usually given in the context of R language being utilised to greater or lesser degree to facilitate data modelling, analytical or statistical work. In that context utilising R yields benefits mostly associated with ability to utilise the existing knowledge. Furthermore, as discussed later, R development team will be able to leverage the existing knowledge or expertise in accomplishing tasks that would traditionally</li>
<li>R is an exceptionally flexible language and offered data structures lend themselves well for file manipulation</li>
<li>Ability for our production process to be migrated across the systems and configurations increases. Let’s consider a simple example of generating temporary files. Utilising R base function <code>tempfile</code> or equiavlent call from the <code>fs</code> package, <code>fs::file_temp()</code> allows for swift creation of temporary files. Achieving that on MS Windows using PowerShell could be done using specific cmdlet called New-TemporaryFile <code>$tmp = New-TemporaryFile</code>. When working in command prompt we would leverage <code>%TEMP%</code> and <code>%RANDOM%</code> environment variables to come up with something like <code>set "uniqueFileName=%tmp%\bat~%RANDOM%.tmp"</code>, as discussed at lengths in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32109191/1655567">the related Stack Overflow answer</a>. The point is that exercises like that incur addittional maintaince cost. Whereas <code>tempfile</code> is straightfoward, well documented and understood by every R user, call:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="coffee"><code>@echo off
setlocal EnableExtensions

rem get unique file name 
:uniqLoop
set &quot;uniqueFileName=%tmp%\bat~%RANDOM%.tmp&quot;
if exist &quot;%uniqueFileName%&quot; goto :uniqLoop</code></pre>
<p>won’t be obvious to maintainers not familiar with command prompt, even if the actual goal behind the two is identical from a production perspective (to provide process with a temporary path)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org">Rocker Project</a> R plays exceptionally well with Docker which is conducive to reducing future maintainability costs and enhancing portability. Decent article covering technicalities of using Docker with R was provided by Colin Fay.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>R has rich ecosystem offering API connectivity. Thanks to <a href="https://www.rplumber.io"><em>Plumber</em></a> R users can, with relatively little effort, generate own APIs. Packages like <a href="https://github.com/gshs-ornl/wbstats"><em>wbstats</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rOpenGov/eurostat"><em>Eurostat</em></a> provide convenient wrappers for sourcing data from publicly available repositories (article World Bank and Eurostat). Those can be immensely time server if we consider building processes that rely on background external demographic/macroeconomic data being incorporated in our processes on regular basis. The subject of R / API integration merits a separate article.</p></li>
<li><p>File format converstion. Through packages like <a href="https://haven.tidyverse.org/"><code>haven</code></a> R offers rich interface to access data in different formats (Stata, SPSS, etc.). When working with bloated legacy processes that may required handling input originating from heterogeneous sources (think SAS binary, in-house Oracle database and some periodical figures produced by World Bank) the R flexibility may prove actual life saver. Still we should be careful not to use R as an excuse not to refactor old processes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="cons" class="section level2">
<h2>Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Using R for file manipulation is not suitable for processes that are mostly in vast majority ETL tasks. If our intention is to monitor a location for change and then conditionally copy files building R-based process will incur an unnecessary dependency, whereas more tools would</p></li>
<li><p>Achieving fine-grained control over common operations may be more difficult in R. Let’s consider <code>rsync</code>. The Internet is full of examples how to achieve properly defined goals using <code>rsync</code>, it is also possible to find Python implementation of the algorithm<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. At the time of writing this article, the attempts to bring <code>rsync</code> functionality relied on command line tool.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>Multithreading, the thinking around multithreading and asynchronous computation in R oscilliates around finding more efficient ways to accomplish computational effort. Whereas packages like <a href="https://github.com/gaborcsardi/async">r-lib/async</a> or <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/processx">r-lib/processx</a> offer aproaches to run processes in the backrgound or perform asynchronous I/O operations; those solutions are applicable to more complex process. Achieveing parallel <code>rsync</code> execution can be easily achieved using <code>xargs</code>, as found on Stack Overflow<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="bash"><code>ls /srv/mail | xargs -n1 -P4 -I% rsync -Pa % myserver.com:/srv/mail/</code></pre>
