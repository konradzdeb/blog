<p>Vim offers variety of functions that can be used to format files. Starting with basic functionalities, like <code>reident</code></p>

<h2>VimL Implementation</h2>
<p>Creating a function within Vim to process the file is, likely, the most straightforward choice. In effect, the role of the function is to pass the filename to the call below:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>autopep8 --verbose --in-place --aggressive --aggressive   ${our_python_file}</code></pre>
<p>In this implementation file path is passed into the formatting function and formatted file is then read back into the buffer.</p>
<pre class="vim"><code>&quot; Aggresively and quickly format Python file
function! FormatThisPythonFile()
	 let filename = expand(&quot;%&quot;)
	 let cmd = &quot;autopep8 --verbose --in-place --aggressive --aggressive &quot; . filename
	 let result = system(cmd)
	 execute(&#39;:edit! &#39; . filename)
	 echo result
endfunction</code></pre>
<p>This implementation has a few major drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to pass the most recent content of the file into the <code>autopep8</code> the file has to be saved</li>
<li>More importantly, the history of the file is also lost at this stage</li>
</ul>
<p>An alternative implementation would refrain from replacing the file content by writing to file and replace the content with the</p>
