<p>Vim offers variety of functions that can be used to format files. Starting with basic functionalities, like <code>reident</code></p>
<div id="implementation-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Implementation 1</h2>
<p>In this implementation file path is passed into the formatting function and formatted file is then read back into the buffer.</p>
<pre class="viml"><code>&quot; Aggresively and quickly format Python file
function! FormatThisPythonFile()
	 let filename = expand(&quot;%&quot;)
	 let cmd = &quot;autopep8 --verbose --in-place --aggressive --aggressive &quot; . filename
	 let result = system(cmd)
	 execute(&#39;:edit! &#39; . filename)
	 echo result
endfunction</code></pre>
<p>This implementation has a few major drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to pass the most recent content of the file into the <code>autopep8</code> the file has to be saved</li>
<li>More importantly, the history of the file is also lost</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="notable-mentions" class="section level2">
<h2>Notable mentions</h2>
<p>Autopep8</p>
</div>
