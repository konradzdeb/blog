Vim offers variety of functions that can be used to format files. Starting with basic functionalities, like `reident`

## Implementation 1
In this implementation file path is passed into the formatting function and formatted file is then read back into the buffer.

```viml
" Aggresively and quickly format Python file
function! FormatThisPythonFile()
	 let filename = expand("%")
	 let cmd = "autopep8 --verbose --in-place --aggressive --aggressive " . filename
	 let result = system(cmd)
	 execute(':edit! ' . filename)
	 echo result
endfunction
```

This implementation has a few major drawbacks:

* In order to pass the most recent content of the file into the `autopep8` the file has to be saved
* More importantly, the history of the file is also lost

## Notable mentions
