In an unlikely scenario that beautiful <a href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiny </a>apps do not meet your analytical requirements and developing a full-blown user interface. in [RGtk2](http://www.ggobi.org/rgtk2/) may seem to be a little too much, there is a third, often overlooked solution, - package [svDialogs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/svDialogs/index.html) by Philippe Grosjean. The package in a convenient way enables user to create various interface gadgets. For example the code:

```{r svDial_example, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
require(svDialogs)

# Let's keep some data in one place
user_figure <- svDialogs::dlg_input()
```

would result in the following window being presented to the user:

![Sample user input](/post/2015-12-01-amusing-way-to-get-user-input-windows-in-r_files/untitled.png)

In this case the code will return the following object:

```{r sample_values, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
str(user_figure)
# Classes 'nativeGUI', 'textCLI', 'gui', 'environment' <environment: 0x11872b648> 
user_figure
# The default SciViews GUI (.GUI)
# using widgets from: nativeGUI, textCLI
# * Last call: dlg_input(gui = .GUI)
# * Last widgets used: nativeGUI
# * Last status: ok
# * Last result:
# [1] "100"
```
