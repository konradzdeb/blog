<p>One of the biggest challenges in Data Science workflow is an ability to commercialise machine learning models. In the context of larger organisations traditional deployment implies deploying models as parts of larger organisational estates. An interesting, alternative, scenario that may be atteractive to many indepent developers implies deploying model in a memory-constrained environment, such as mobile device. In this post I’m using CoreML paired with Python’s coremltools</p>
