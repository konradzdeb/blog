<p>Most frequently, users tend to undertake common R installation and management tasks from within the R session. Frequently making use of commands, like <code>install.packages</code>, <code>update.packages</code> or <code>old.packages</code> to obtain or update packages or update/verify the existing packages. Those common tasks can also be accomplished via the GUI offered within RStudio, which provides an effortless mechanism for undertaking basic package management tasks. This is approach is usually sufficient for the vast majority of cases; however, there are some examples when working within REPL<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to accomplish common installation tasks is not hugely convenient.</p>
<p>For example, we may be utilising multiple library paths and our intention may be to update only one of the available libraries, which we use as a baseline for all new projects<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. If our <code>.libPaths()</code> returns a content similar to the one below, we may be interested only in updating the first repository.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>.libPaths()
# [1] &quot;/Users/thisUserName/Library/R/4/library&quot;
# [2] &quot;/usr/local/Cellar/r/4.1.2/lib/R/library&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This outcome can be achieved using <code>update.packages(lib.loc =  .libPaths()[1])</code> but if our intention is to pass more arguments to the call, running this command frequently becomes more tedious and unnecessarily onerous. Python users will be familiar with Conda and pip and, while working in R, may be longing for a solution offering a similar, convenient command line mechanism facilitating execution of basic installation and package management tasks. For instance in Conda we would simply do <code>conda install package-name=2.3.4</code> to install a package of a specific version. Similarly we can simply run <code>conda update --all -y</code> to update all packages unprompted or pass further arguments to update packages within a specific environment and so forth. Pip offers a number of similar convenience features.</p>

<h2>“Requirements”</h2>
<p>I was interested in at a R-based solution that would offer a comparable level of convenience. However, as R does not offer package management mechanism that would be out of the box accessible via command line.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution" class="section level1">
<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>R offers two interfaces for running scripts and commands without starting an interactive session: <code>R CMD</code> and <code>RScript</code><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. <code>R CMD</code> is an older interface facilitating command and script execution via command line. <code>Rscript</code> came later and is, in general, more flexible. Readers interested in the subject should start research from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/21969145/1655567">this StackOverflow</a> discussion that provides a good primer on key differences.</p>
<div id="updating-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Updating Packages</h2>
<p>In the process of updating packages we will be usually interested in achieving two goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying any outdated packages that may benefit from updating</li>
<li>Running an update for outdated packages every so often. This is relatively good habit, comparable to running <code>brew upgrade</code> with some frequency so we can avoid our production environment staying far behind current stable releases.</li>
</ul>
<div id="outdated-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>Outdated packages</h3>
<p>For a start, let’s attempt to construct a data frame containing the outdated packages using <code>Rscript</code>. This is achieved in the following manner</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>Rscript --no-save --no-restore --no-init-file \
        -e &#39;as.data.frame(old.packages(repos = &quot;https://cran.rstudio.com&quot;))[,-c(1,6)]&#39;</code></pre>
<p>If we intend to execute this command frequently it may be useful to wrap in a function. As we are not intending to pass any arguments to the function this is trivial:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>function routdated () {
        Rscript --no-save --no-restore --no-init-file \
        -e &#39;as.data.frame(old.packages(repos = &quot;https://cran.rstudio.com&quot;))[,-c(1,6)]&#39;
}
routdated</code></pre>
<div id="explanation" class="section level4">
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<p>Let’s break this down. <code>Rscript</code> can be run with multiple switches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--no-init-file</code> skips reading of the <code>.Rprofile</code> files. As I keep my library path stored within the <code>Renviron</code> file, I’m skipping processing of the <code>.RProfile</code> file. Traditionally, <code>.RProfile</code> is used to configure default repositories but I pref to specify the repository directly in the call as I want to update against RStudio’s one</li>
<li><code>--no-save</code> prevents <code>RScript</code> from saving data on exit</li>
<li><code>-e</code> is used to specify the call that <code>RScript</code> is expected to execute</li>
</ul>
<p>A point of note, if you specify your library paths using <code>RProfile</code> file you may need to remove the <code>--no-init-file</code> switch.</p>

<div id="installing-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing packages</h2>
<p>Installing packages from console is useful if we want to undertake those tasks outside the ongoing workflow. Let’s say that we are working on a project and looking for package facilitating quick generation of tabular summaries or some relevant visuals. We could use <code>install.packages</code> from the REPL session we are in but if the package is requiring compilation we are get quite a lot of output that is not pertinent to the task at hand. Another common approach would be to start another session and run install command there. RStudio also facilitates running background processes but that’s a little bit of an overkill for a simple task.</p>
<p>A sensible middle ground solution would be to run the package installation via <code>RScript</code> we could conveniently call it as a background process or just start in a new tab when working with any popular terminal client supporting this functionality.</p>
<pre class="bash"><code># Function body
function rinst () {
	declare pkgnme=$1
	Rscript --vanilla -e &quot;install.packages(&#39;$pkgnme&#39;, dependencies = TRUE, repos = &#39;https://cloud.r-project.org/&#39;, lib = &#39;/Users/konrad/Library/R/4/library&#39;)&quot;
}</code></pre>
<div id="explanation-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>As I want for this function to install only to a specific library and from a specific repository I’m using the <code>--vanilla</code> switch to let Rscript know that I don’t need it to process <code>.RProfile</code> and other files in this particular call as I’m storing the relevant arguments within the function.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In all likelihood, for more sophisticated projects solutions like <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/"><code>renv</code></a> and <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org">Rocker</a> are a way to go. Nevertheless combination of Rscript / bash can prove very efficient in quickly accomplishing routine maintenance tasks.</p>
